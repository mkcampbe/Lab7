# Import data

Import shared table and format for phyloseq. Phyloseq works by matching rownames across matrix objects (This is similar to how we matched columns in joins of data frames). A two-dimensional matrix in R looks just like a data frame, however R matrices can be three-dimensional. A three-dimensional object is created when multiple two-dimensional objects are combined (we'll work through this in the upcoming sections). 

```{r}
shared_m <- read_delim("raw_data/Lab7_data/MMP_thruf19_filtered.shared",
                            delim = "\t", escape_double = FALSE, 
                            trim_ws = TRUE, na=c("NA"),
                            col_types = list()) %>%
  # separate Group column by underscores
  separate(col = Group, 
           into = c("participant_id", "sample_number", "seq_num"),
           sep = "_", extra = "drop") %>%
  # combine columns to make new sample id column 
  mutate(sample_id = paste(participant_id, sample_number, sep = "_")) %>% 
  # drop extra columns, reorder columns
  select(sample_id, starts_with("Otu")) %>%
  # drop control samples from sequencing
  filter(str_detect(sample_id, "^U")) %>%
  # remove duplicate sample ids
  distinct(sample_id, .keep_all = TRUE) %>% 
  # sample IDs need to be made into row names
  column_to_rownames(var = "sample_id") %>% 
  # convert data frame to matrix object
  as.matrix() %>% 
  # convert to phyloseq object 
  otu_table(., taxa_are_rows = FALSE) 
```

Import taxonomy table and format for phyloseq.
```{r}
taxa_m <- read_delim("raw_data//Lab7_data/MMP_thruf19.taxonomy",
                            delim = "\t", escape_double = FALSE, 
                            trim_ws = TRUE, na=c("NA")) %>%
  # sequence variants (OTUs) need to be made into row names 
  column_to_rownames(var = "ESV") %>% 
  as.matrix() %>%
  # convert to phyloseq object 
  tax_table()  
```

Import sample data and format for phyloseq.
```{r}
samples_m <- read_delim("raw_data/Lab7_data/all_data_indv.txt", 
                            delim = "\t", escape_double = FALSE, 
                            trim_ws = TRUE, 
                            col_types = cols(Sample_number = col_character(),
                                             Bristol_numeric = col_number(),
                                             Bristol_score = col_character(), 
                                             pH = col_number())) %>%
  # make all column names lower case
  rename_all(tolower) %>% 
  # remove duplicate sample ids
  distinct(., sample_id, .keep_all = TRUE) %>%  
  # sample IDs need to be made into row names
  column_to_rownames(var = "sample_id") %>% 
  # specify type of phyloseq object
  sample_data() 
```

Import sample data as data frame for later analyses: 
```{r}
# format sample data 
samples_df <- read_delim("raw_data/Lab7_data/all_data_indv.txt", 
                            delim = "\t", escape_double = FALSE, 
                            trim_ws = TRUE, 
                            col_types = cols(Sample_number = col_character(),
                                             Bristol_numeric = col_number(),
                                             Bristol_score = col_character(), 
                                             pH = col_number())) %>%
  # make all column names lower case
  rename_all(tolower) %>% 
  # remove duplicate sample ids
  distinct(., sample_id, .keep_all = TRUE) %>%  
  # subset for samples, semesters, weeks of interest 
  filter(use_data == "yes", 
         quantity_compliant != "no",
         semester != "Winter2015",

# Create phyloseq objects

Phyloseq is an R package that has a suite of functions that make microbial community anaylsis a bit simpler. https://joey711.github.io/phyloseq/index.html 9for extra pratice)!!! good stuff on here for subsetting and filterin!! It requires the data to be structured in three critical files (1) shared table (sequence variants or OTUs) that contains counts of each sequence; (2) Taxanomic information that contains classifications from Phylum to species for each sequence variant; (3) sample information, which is the participant information we have been working with so far this semester. We imported and formatted these three files in the section above, now we have to combine them into one object. 
```{r}
# combine three phyloseq objects created above
physq_obj <- phyloseq(shared_m, taxa_m, samples_m) %>% 
  # subset for consent and compliance
  subset_samples(., use_data == "yes") %>%
  subset_samples(., quantity_compliant != "no") %>%
  # remove problematic semester(s)
  subset_samples(., semester != "Winter2015") %>% 
  # subset for weeks of interest
  subset_samples(., study_week == "week1" | study_week == "week3") %>%
  # subset for potato supplements 
  subset_samples(., supplement_consumed == "BRMPS" | supplement_consumed == "LOODAT")

physq_obj #view dimentions of new object 
```

# Visualize taxa

### Avg Phyla Rel Abund 
Before we plot the OTUs, we have to combine the counts from each week into a single average. 
```{r}
physq_phyla <- physq_obj %>% 
  # tax glom groups together taxa with the same name
  tax_glom("Phylum") %>%
  # convert counts to relative abundance 
  transform_sample_counts(function(x) {x/sum(x)} ) %>%
  # convert phyloseq object (matrix) to data frame 
  psmelt() %>%
  # sort alphabetically 
  arrange(Phylum) %>%
  # Calculate weekly mean of relative abundance
  group_by(participant_id, study_week, semester, 
           frequency, supplement_consumed, Phylum, OTU) %>%
  summarise(relative_abundance = mean(Abundance, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  # remove low abundance taxa
  filter(relative_abundance > 0.001)
physq_phyla
```

### LOODAT plot 
The code below filters for participants who consumed LOODAT potato starch, then plots the relative abundance of each phyla found in each participant. 
```{r}
ld3_plot <- physq_phyla %>%
  # filter for supplement and study week 
  filter(supplement_consumed == "LOODAT",
         study_week == "week3") %>% 
  # set parameters for plot
  ggplot(aes(x = participant_id, y = relative_abundance,
             fill = Phylum,
             study_week, frequency)) + 
  # layer for stacked bar plot 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  # clean up x-axis 
  theme(axis.title.x = element_blank(), #remove x-axis label 
        axis.text.x =  element_text(angle = 90, #rotate tick labels 
                                    vjust = 0.5,
                                    hjust = 0.5,
                                    size = 8)) +
  # clean up y-axis
  ylab("Relative Abundance\n(% total sequences)") +
  ggtitle("Week 3 - LOODAT")
ld3_plot
```

### BRMPS 1x plot 
The code below filters for participants who consumed BRMPS once a day, then plots the relative abundance of each phyla found in each participant. 
```{r}
brm1_plot <- physq_phyla %>%
  filter(supplement_consumed == "BRMPS",
         frequency == "1xdaily",
         study_week == "week3") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = participant_id, y = relative_abundance,
             fill = Phylum,
             study_week, frequency)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  theme(axis.title.x = element_blank(),
        axis.text.x =  element_text(angle = 90,
                                    vjust = 0.5,
                                    hjust = 0.5,
                                    size = 8)) +
  ylab("Relative Abundance\n(% total sequences)") +
  ggtitle("Week 3 - BRMPS 1xdaily")
brm1_plot
```

### BRMPS 2x plot 
The section filters for participants who consumed BRMPS twice a day, then plots the relative abundance of each phyla found in each participant. 
```{r}
brm2_plot <- physq_phyla %>%
  filter(supplement_consumed == "BRMPS",
         frequency == "2xdaily",
         study_week == "week3") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = participant_id, y = relative_abundance,
             fill = Phylum,
             study_week, frequency)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  theme(axis.title.x = element_blank(),
        axis.text.x =  element_text(angle = 90,
                                    vjust = 0.5,
                                    hjust = 0.5,
                                    size = 8)) +
  ylab("Relative Abundance\n(% total sequences)") +
  ggtitle("Week 3 - BRMPS 2xdaily")
brm2_plot
```

### Combine plots 
We would like to see if the consumption of different brands of potato starches results in different community composition. The easiest way to do this would be to place the barplots side by side. 
```{r}
plot_1day <- plot_grid(ld3_plot, brm1_plot,
          nrow = 1, ncol = 2)
plot_1day
```
Expand the plot window to view the plot. Notice that there is a different number of phyla in each figure, with ggplot default colors this means the same group (e.g. Bacteroidetes) doesn't show up as the same color. We can replace these colors with a standard color palette. 
```{r}
phylum_colors_L <- c("#00767d", "#d38665", "#0d8462", "#d68ab9",
                   "#a6a55d", 
                   "#907030")

phylum_colors_B <- c("#00767d", "#d38665", "#0d8462", "#d68ab9",
                   "#31745c", "#8564a4", "#a6a55d", "#975657",
                   "#656c4c", "#907030")
```

```{r}
ld3_plot_new <- ld3_plot + 
  scale_fill_manual(values = phylum_colors_L) 

brm1_plot_new <- brm1_plot + 
  scale_fill_manual(values = phylum_colors_B)

plot_1day_new <- plot_grid(ld3_plot_new, brm1_plot_new,
          nrow = 1, ncol = 2)
plot_1day_new
```

Now we can see that the colors/phlya combinations are consistent between each panel, we can further clean up this plot by removing duplicate legends and axis labels. 
```{r}
# create a plot object just for the legend 
leg_1day <- get_legend(brm1_plot + 
  scale_fill_manual(values = phylum_colors_B))

# set colors, remove legend
ld3_plot_new <- ld3_plot + 
  scale_fill_manual(values = phylum_colors_L) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
# set colors, remove legend, hide y-axis label 
brm1_plot_new <- brm1_plot + 
  scale_fill_manual(values = phylum_colors_B) +
  ylab(NULL) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")

# combine two figures, add legend, adjust widths
plot_1day_new <- plot_grid(ld3_plot_new, brm1_plot_new, leg_1day, 
          nrow = 1, ncol = 3,
          rel_widths = c(1.5, 3.5, 1))
plot_1day_new

# save final plot 
save_plot(plot_1day_new,
          base_width = 12, base_height = 4,
          filename = "figures/plot_1day_new.pdf")
```

### Practice 1
Plot and save the BRMPS 1xdaily and 2xdaily figures side by side. Save as final plot as "brmps_barplot.pdf". 
```{r}

```

### Practice 2
Create a data frame from the phyloseq object created earlier that contains the weekly average relative abundace at the family level.
```{r}

```

Create a stacked bar plot for participants who consumed BRMPS twice a day. Use facets to create a panel for each study week. 
```{r}
brmps_plot <- physq_phyla %>%
  filter(supplement_consumed == "BRMPS",
         frequency == "2xdaily",
         #study_week == "week3"
         ) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = participant_id, y = relative_abundance,
             fill = Phylum,
             study_week, frequency)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  facet_grid(~study_week, scales = "free") +
  theme(axis.title.x = element_blank(),
        axis.text.x =  element_text(angle = 90,
                                    vjust = 0.5,
                                    hjust = 0.5,
                                    size = 8)) +
  ylab("Relative Abundance\n(% total sequences)") +
  ggtitle("Week 1 vs Week 3 - BRMPS 2xdaily")
brmps_plot
```

# Alpha diversity

There are numerous alpha diversity metrics, however we are going to focus on observed (richness) and Simpson (evenness) for our analyses. We will calculate, plot, extract information about alpha diversity with the plot_richness() function. 

### Calculate richness
Import sample data, format and filter data frame for samples in which we want to investigate the richness. 
```{r}
samp_data <- read_delim("raw_data/Lab7_data/all_data_indv.txt", 
                            delim = "\t", escape_double = FALSE, 
                            trim_ws = TRUE, 
                            col_types = cols(Sample_number = col_character(),
                                             Bristol_numeric = col_number(),
                                             Bristol_score = col_character(), 
                                             pH = col_number())) %>% #import sample data again
  rename_all(tolower) %>% #make all column names lower case
  distinct(., sample_id, .keep_all = TRUE) %>%
  select(participant_id, sample_number, sample_id, study_week, 
         semester, supplement_consumed, frequency, quantity_compliant) %>% #drop extra columns 
  filter(semester != "Winter2015",
         quantity_compliant != "no",
         study_week == "week1" | study_week == "week3",
         supplement_consumed == "BRMPS" | supplement_consumed == "LOODAT")
```

Caculate richness
```{r}
richness_df <- physq_obj %>%
  # calculate richness
  estimate_richness(., split = TRUE,  measures = c("Observed")) %>% 
  # make sample_id column before join 
  rownames_to_column(var = "sample_id") %>% 
  # join with sample data imported above
  inner_join(samp_data, by = "sample_id") %>%  
  rename(richness = Observed) %>%
  # calculate average richness per person, per week 
  group_by(participant_id, study_week, semester, 
           frequency, supplement_consumed) %>%
  summarise(avg_richness = round(mean(richness), digits = 0)) 

richness_df
```

### Plot richness
```{r}
# Plot richness
rich1 <- physq_obj %>%
  plot_richness(., "study_week", measures = c("Observed")) +
  facet_grid("supplement_consumed") +
  ylab("Richness (Observed ESVs)") + xlab(NULL)
rich1
```

This plot is pretty basic. Below we will update the plot with some of our preffered display settings. 
```{r}
rich1$layers <- rich1$layers[-1] #drop geom_point 

rich2 <- rich1 +   
  geom_violin(aes(color = study_week)) + #add violin in color
  geom_jitter(aes(color = study_week)) +  #add individual points in color 
  theme(legend.position = "none")
rich2
```

### Statistical test
We can use alpha diversity metrics (richness, evenness) in the same manner as any other measured characteristic. So, if we want to determine if the consumption of a LOODAT significantly richness we would use the data frame created in the section above to conduct a paired t-test. 
```{r}
# susbet for one supplement 
rich_LD <- richness_df %>%
  filter(supplement_consumed == "LOODAT")

### check assumptions 
# sample size
rich_LD %>%
  group_by(study_week) %>%
  summarise(counts = n())

# normality checks
rich_wk1 <- rich_LD %>%
  filter(study_week == "week1")
rich_wk3 <- richness_df %>%
  filter(study_week == "week3")
shapiro.test(rich_wk1$avg_richness) #p-value = 0.4924
shapiro.test(rich_wk3$avg_richness) # p-value = 0.6605
# histogram and qqplot for normality checks
ggplot(rich_wk1, aes(x=avg_richness)) +
  geom_histogram() 
qqnorm(rich_wk1$avg_richness); qqline(rich_wk1$avg_richness)
ggplot(rich_wk3, aes(x=avg_richness)) +
  geom_histogram() 
qqnorm(rich_wk3$avg_richness); qqline(rich_wk3$avg_richness)
```

Based on the results of the assumption-checks above we will proceed with a non-parametric test. 
```{r}
# format data for test
rich_df_wide <- rich_LD %>%
  spread(key = "study_week", value = "avg_richness") %>%
  drop_na()

# conduct test 
wilcox.test(rich_df_wide$week1, rich_df_wide$week3, 
            alternative = "two.sided", paired = TRUE) # p-value = ?
```

Did you conclude the richness changed from week 1 to week 3 in individuals who consumped LOODAT? the richness did change from week 1 to week 3 because our p-value of 0.02531 which is less than our significance level. Additionally, the widest part of the violin plots of the average richness value between week 1 and week 3 appear to be different.  

### Practice 3

Create a plot that shows the richness across weeks 1 and 3 in participants who consumed BRMPS once and twice a day. Hint: use facets. facet = facet_grid(~frequency, scales = "free_x") 
way to further subset data and still end up with only one figure. could also faet_grid(~study_week, scale)
```{r}

```

Conduct statistical tests to determine if the richness was significantly different in participants who consumed BRMPS twice a day. 
```{r}

```

Conduct statistical tests to determine the if the richness was significantly different in participants who consumed BRMPS once a day. 
```{r}

```


# Beta diversity 

Before calculating diversity indices (Bray-Curtis or Jaccard) we need to subset our read counts to an even depth. This means we have the same number of sequences reads in each sample. 
```{r}
# create a subset of the phyloseq object
physq_sub <- physq_obj %>% 
  subset_samples(., supplement_consumed == "BRMPS") %>%
  subset_samples(., frequency == "2xdaily") %>%
  prune_taxa(taxa_sums(.) > 1000, .) %>%
  prune_samples(sample_sums(.) > 1000, .)

# get read counts 
sample_sum_df <- data.frame(sum = sample_sums(physq_sub))

# Histogram of sample read counts
ggplot(sample_sum_df, aes(x = sum)) + 
  geom_histogram(color = "black", fill = "gray", binwidth = 2500) +
  ggtitle("Distribution of sample sequencing depth") + 
  xlab("Read counts") +
  theme(axis.title.y = element_blank())

# Summary statistics on read counts 
min(sample_sums(physq_sub)) #1174
mean(sample_sums(physq_sub)) #22810
max(sample_sums(physq_sub))  #49192

# scale samples to even depth using custom function
physq_scale <- physq_sub %>%
  scale_reads(round = "round") 
```

### Conduct ordination analysis

This step calculates the diveristy index (using Bray Curtis in the example below), and does the ranking process of the diveristy indices to generate the information necessary to create a two-dimensional plot. Notice the arguments in the ordinate function; the index, Bray Curtis ("bray") or Jaccard ("jaccard"), is specified in the distance agurment, and with either of these metrics we will use method = "NMDS". The place were you might want to make some modifications is the k or number of dimensions (this should be somewhere between 1-3), the maximum number of iterations (depending on computer memory this can take several minutes to calculate), and the inital number of interations to try (100 in the example below). These can be modified to reduce the stress, with the goal of a number less than 0.20 (the lower the better). 

```{r}
# use ordinate function on subset *** play around with the numbers to see how it affects the output 
physq_bc <- ordinate(physq_scale, 
           method = "NMDS", 
           k=3, maxit=500, try=50,
           distance = "bray")  # switch this to distance = "jaccard" for jaccard score 
physq_bc
```
want stress to be less than 0.2. 

### Plot results

For these plots we will use the phyloseq function plot_ordination() instead of ggplot(). Grouping variables can we assigned to color and shape, here they are differnet (study week and semester) but sometimes you may want them to be the same. 
```{r}
ordplot1 <- plot_ordination(physeq = physq_sub, 
                     ordination = physq_bc, 
                     type = "samples", 
                     color = "study_week", 
                     shape = "semester")
print(ordplot1)
```

### Modify plots

The phyloseq plot functions work nicely with ggplot layers. They can modified with ggplot functions you already know. The process to save these plots is the same, use save_plot(). 

See this website for color options: http://sape.inf.usi.ch/quick-reference/ggplot2/colour 
And this site for shape options: http://sape.inf.usi.ch/quick-reference/ggplot2/shape 
```{r}
ordplot2 <- plot_ordination(physeq = physq_sub, 
                     ordination = physq_bc, 
                     type = "samples", 
                     color = "study_week", 
                     shape = "study_week") +
  # increase point size
  geom_point(size=3) +

### Statistical test

If you observe a pattern (separation of points from different groups) in your ordination plot, we can determine if that is to a significant level with analysis of similarities using distance matrices (ANOSIM or ADONIS). Using the ordination object from the section above, we run the test with the adonis() function, which is part of the vegan package. 
```{r}
# start with same phyloseq object as above 
# calculate BC index, get distance matrix
dat_bray <- phyloseq::distance(physq_sub, method = "bray") 
#change method = "jaccard"
sampledf <- physq_sub %>% 
  sample_data(.) %>% #extract sample data from phyloseq object 
  as(., "data.frame") #convert to data frame for adonis()

# run test
adn_res <- adonis(formula = dat_bray ~ study_week, 
                  data = sampledf)

# view results 
print(adn_res)
```

Review the output from the adonis function, this format should be slightly familar to you now; we are interested in the R-squared (R2) and the p-value (Pr(>F)) columns. The p-value indicates the groups are statistically significant. The R-squared value can be interpretd as the effect size, it shows the percentage of variation explained by the grouping categories (here study week and semester). For this test, an R-squared value close to 1 indicaates dissimilarity between the groups, while an R value near 0 indicates no significant dissimilarity between the groups. 

In our results above, the p-values of 0.001 indicate that the groupings of samples by study week is statistically significant. However, the R value of 0.00959 is fairly close to 0, indicating that the grouping of samples based by study week is weak. When this occurs (low p and low R), the variation of the samples in the tested groups likely is influencing the results of the test. 

If communities are different between the two conditions being compared we would expect to see low p and high R. 

### Practice 4

Repeat the ordination plot and analysis as completed above, but use the Jaccard index instead of Bray-Curtis. Do your conclusions differ based on the index used? 
```{r}
# ordinate
physq_j <- ordinate(physq_scale, 
           method = "NMDS", 
           k=3, maxit=500, try=50,
           distance = "jaccard")  # switch this to distance = "jaccard" for jaccard score 
physq_j
```

```{r}
# plot
ordplot3 <- plot_ordination(physeq = physq_sub, 
                     ordination = physq_j, 
                     type = "samples", 
                     color = "study_week", 
                     shape = "study_week") +
  # increase point size
  geom_point(size=3) + 
  # change default color palette 
  scale_color_manual(name = "Study week",
                     values = c("coral3", 
                                "skyblue3"),
                     labels = c("week 1",
                                "week 3")) + 
  # change default shapes
  scale_shape_manual(name = "Study week",
                     values = c(7, 8),
                     labels = c("week 1", "week 3"))  
print(ordplot3)
```

```{r}
# statistical test 
# start with same phyloseq object as above 
# calculate BC index, get distance matrix
dat_jac <- phyloseq::distance(physq_sub, method = "jaccard") 
#change method = "jaccard"
sampledf2 <- physq_sub %>% 
  sample_data(.) %>% #extract sample data from phyloseq object 
  as(., "data.frame") #convert to data frame for adonis()

# run test
adn_res2 <- adonis(formula = dat_jac ~ study_week, 
                  data = sampledf2)

# view results 
print(adn_res2)
```
